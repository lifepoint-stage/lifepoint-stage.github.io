Our goal at LifePoint is to help children:

- Come to know and love Jesus
- Grow in a relationship with Him
- Learn the Word of God
- Learn how to love others

Our ministry is designed to help your children learn about God in a safe and loving environment. After a time of singing as a whole congregation, the children will be released to go downstairs to their age appropriate classes.

- Nursery: Birth to 3 years
- Preschool-kindergarten
- Grades 1 and 2
- Grades 3-4

If you have any questions, feel free to call Sonia Neubaum at (209) 531-3174.
