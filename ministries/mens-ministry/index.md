**Men's bible study meets Tuesdays at 7:00 (on break - resuming after the new year)**

LifePoint Church Men’s Ministry is dedicated to helping men become the spiritual leaders that the Lord is calling them to be.  Our goal is to provide opportunities where men can connect and become the leaders, husbands, fathers and servants that God has designed them to be.

“So the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”  2 Timothy 3:17
