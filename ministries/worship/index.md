We sing a lot together at LifePoint. We believe that musical worship is a powerful way to spend time together and with God.

We believe:

- Praise &amp; worship allows us to focus our hearts on God - **Jer 29:13**
- Praise &amp; worship are a part of God's kingdom - **Psa 33, Eph 5:19, &amp; Rev 5:13**
- Praise &amp; worship allows us to sing the bible. The worship songs we choose to sing as a body must glorify God above all. The songs we sing as LifePoint are often quoting or directly inspired by passages from the Bible. **Psa 86:15**
- Praise &amp; worship guides our hearts through a progression &mdash; from entering in as a body to purely vertical worship (singing to God about God) - **Rev 4**
